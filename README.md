# RefinedMeanField_SynchronousPopulation

This repository contains what is needed to reproduce the paper "A
  Refined Mean Field Approximation for Synchronous Population
  Processes" (this includes the Python code for the simulations and
  the LaTeX code of the paper)

## How to run the simulations 

To run the simulation, a working installation of Python (including
numpy, matplotlib and jupyter) is needed. Then, just open the two
notebooks (discrete_timeSIR.ipynb and unstable1Dmodel.ipynb) of the
folder *simu/* and run them with Jupyter.
