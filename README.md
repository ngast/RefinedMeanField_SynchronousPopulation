# RefinedMeanField_SynchronousPopulation

This repository contains what is needed to reproduce the papers :

* the paper "A Refined Mean Field Approximation of Synchronous
  Discrete-Time Population Models" (accepted at Performance
  Evaluation)

* The extended abstract "A Refined Mean Field Approximation for
  Synchronous Population Processes" (presented at the workshop MAMA
  2018)

This includes the Python code for the simulations (directory simu/)
and the LaTeX code of the papers. The directory slides/ contains the
slides of the presentation at MAMA.

## How to run the simulations 

To run the simulation, a working installation of Python (including
numpy, matplotlib and jupyter) is needed. Then, each notebook
(discrete_timeSEIR.ipynb , unstable1Dmodel.ipynb , MajorityRule.ipynb
and WSN_model.ipynb) can be run independently using Jupyter.
